# 2023
The Repository contains the materials for Applied Data Analysis CS-401 course I have taken at EPFL in 2023 Fall. The repository is structured into the following sections:

### Exercises
Programming exercises on the weekly course topics.

### Homework
Throughout the course, two homework assignments were given, allowing a two-week timeframe for completion on each.

### Exam 
This section encompasses previous year's exams (2019-2022) that I personally solved, along with the actual exam (2023) administered at the conclusion of the course. Solutions for these exams are given in the corresponding `exam.ipynb` notebook.

Finally, [this](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2023-project-datasquad2023) repository contains the project we did throughout the course, which we worked on for ~1.5 month in a team of 5.
